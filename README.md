# GitHub Job Application Project

This GitHub Job Application Project is a web application developed to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. The project demonstrates the use of local storage concepts to store user inputs across multiple pages. It comprises three main pages: a form page for input, a table page displaying the entered data, and a bookmark page for managing bookmarked entries. Notably, this project does not incorporate any API integration and serves as a fundamental exercise for JavaScript practice.

## Features

- **Input Form**: The first page of the application features a form where users can input job application details such as job title, company name, location, etc.
- **Data Table**: Upon submission of the form, the application navigates to the second page, presenting a table displaying all the entered inputs.
- **Bookmark Button**: In the table page, users can bookmark entries of interest using a dedicated bookmark button.
- **Bookmark Page**: Clicking on the bookmark button redirects users to a third page dedicated to managing bookmarked entries.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Local Storage Implementation

Local storage is utilized throughout the project to persist user inputs and bookmarked entries across different pages. By leveraging the browser's local storage feature, the application ensures that user data is retained even after page refreshes or browser closures. This seamless experience enhances user convenience and provides a smoother interaction with the application.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Fill out the input form with relevant job application details and submit.
4. Navigate to the table page to view the entered data.
5. Click on the bookmark button to mark entries of interest.
6. Navigate to the bookmark page to manage bookmarked entries.
7. Enjoy exploring and practicing JavaScript concepts with this simple yet functional project!
